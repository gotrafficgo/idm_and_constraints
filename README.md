# Intelligent Driver Model and its Constrants in Coding

## Abstract
I found the additional constraints large influence the results of IDM-based simulation. I report some of them here. Note: The well-known **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)** proposed by Martin Treiber et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002177).
